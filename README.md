# hello-world
Folder created to share and store my ideas for development
It tells me in the guide here to write a little about myself. Well a little about myself would still be a long story, but lets keep it simple. My name is Jacob, im 20 Years old, and I live in Nashville Tennessee. I dream to become a well known developer someday. I love Android and really just Google anything. That is basically me in 2 sentences so there ya go!
